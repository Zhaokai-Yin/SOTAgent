# SOTAgent
## ❓ What can SOTAgent do?
With the rapid increase in the number of AI conferences and papers, selecting a baseline has become extremely difficult. The latest State-of-the-art (SOTA) models on our chosen benchmarks are updated periodically. After the Paperwithcode website became unusable, finding the current state-of-the-art model became very challenging, often requiring significant effort. This is highly inefficient in terms of time and manpower. To allow researchers to focus more on paper writing and coding experiments rather than struggling to find the latest SOTA model, we developed an agent that helps us find the latest SOTA model on our desired benchmark. We named it **SOTAgent**.
